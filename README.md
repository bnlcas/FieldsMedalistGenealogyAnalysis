# FieldsMedalistGenealogyAnalysis
This repository contains functions to analyze the academic lineages of Mathematicians who won the [Fields Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal).
The data was taken from the [Mathematics Genealogy Project](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu) using a webscraper built by [Jeremy Kun](https://jeremykun.com).
The source code for the data scrapping can be found on [his github](https://github.com/j2kun/math-genealogy-scraper).

I was mostly interested in the history of mathematics and the concentration of elite mathematicians in academic lineages, so this script focues on this aspect of the data.
Prehaps the strangest thing that came out of this is that 64% of Fields Medalists have an academic lineage that can be traced back to [Shams ad-Din Al-Bukhari](http://islamsci.mcgill.ca/RASI/BEA/Shams_al-Din_al-Bukhari_BEA.htm) - a medieval astronomer from modern day Uzbekistan.
Had a single Greek not come to study astronmy in Central Asia, this line would have never been brought into Western Europe.

To run my analysis, pull the repo and run `main('what_ever_directory_the_project_is_in')`.
